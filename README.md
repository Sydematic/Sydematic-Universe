Welcome to **Sydematic’s Portfolio Showcase** — an interactive journey through my creative world of tech, film, music, math and beyond.  
Each section highlights a unique aspect of who I am, what I build, and what inspires me.

## 🔧 How to Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sp184218/Sydni_P_JS_API_Final_Project.git
cd Sydematic-Developer
# Open index.html in your browser
```

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- Vite  
- JavaScript  
- React  
- Animation  
- Tailwind CSS  
- UI/UX  

With the help of **Lovable**, I was able to work from a solid UI template. While the original files were in `.tsx`, I translated everything to `.jsx` using some smart AI tools — which made it easier to focus on JavaScript logic and styling without the TypeScript overhead.

## 💡 Notes

- Best viewed on desktop  
- Fully responsive and mobile-friendly  
- Built with clarity, creativity, and performance in mind  

## 📁 More Info

Check out the README file in the `Sydematic-Developer` folder for deeper details about the webpage structure and implementation.

## ⚡ Key Points

- The code block for “How to Run Locally” is properly closed  
- All badges and links are outside the code block so they’re clickable  
- Ready to paste directly into GitHub or any markdown viewer


💡 Notes

Best viewed on desktop, but can be viewed very well on mobile too!!
