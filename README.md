## 🚀 Tech Stack
- Vite
- JavaScript
- React
- Animation
- Tailwind CSS
- UI/UX
- With the help of Lovable providing a nice template to work on. Due to time constraints, Lovable managed to help with getting the UI files done in a timely manner, while it was in tsx, I managed to translate it to jsx with some cool ai tools while being able to focus on javascript and styling much easier and less hassle. 


💡 Notes

Best viewed on desktop, but can be viewed very well on mobile too!!
