- With the help of Lovable providing a nice template to work on.
Due to time constraints, Lovable managed to help with getting the
UI files done in a timely manner, while it was in tsx, I managed to
translate it to jsx with some cool ai tools while being able to focus
on javascript and styling much easier and less hassle.
